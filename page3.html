		<p> This unit introduces the foundational concepts of computer programming, which unlocks the ability to make rich, interactive apps. This course uses JavaScript as the programming language, and App Lab as the programming environment to build apps, but the concepts learned in these lessons span all programming languages and tools.

		<h3> 
			Vocabulary
		</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><span class = "font1">
			<li><span class = "font1">
			Algorithm: </span> A list of steps to finish a task.
			</li> 
			<li><span class = "font1">
			High Level Programming Language: </span> A programming language with many commands and features designed to make common tasks easier to program. Any high level functionality is encapsulated as combinations of low level commands.
			</li>
			<li><span class = "font1">
			Low Level Programming Language: </span> A programming language that captures only the most primitive operations available to a machine. Anything that a computer can do can be represented with combinations of low level commands.
			</li>
			<li><span class = "font1">
			Iterate: </span> To repeat in order to achieve, or get closer to, a desired goal.
			</li>
			<li><span class = "font1">
			Selection: </span> A generic term for a type of programming statement (usually an if-statement) that uses a Boolean condition to determine, or select, whether or not to run a certain block of statements.
			</li>
			<li><span class = "font1">
			Sequencing: </span> Putting commands in correct order so computers can read the commands.
			</li>
			<li><span class = "font1">
			Abstraction: </span> A simplified representation of something more complex. Abstractions allow you to hide details to help you manage complexity, focus on relevant concepts, and reason about problems at a higher level.
			</li>
			<li><span class = "font1">
			Pair Programming: </span> A method of programming in which two programmers write code using a single computer. One programmer in the "driver" role uses the mouse and keyboard to actually write the code while a second acts as a "navigator", keeping track of the big picture, catching errors, and making suggestions. Programmers switch roles frequently and communicate throughout the process.
			</li>
			<li><span class = "font1">
			Turtle Programming: </span> a classic method for learning programming with commands to control movement and drawing of an on-screen robot called a "turtle". The turtle hearkens back to early implementations in which children programmed a physical robot whose dome-like shape was reminiscent of a turtle.
			</li>
			<img src="images/msfs.jpg" title="Microsoft Flight Simulator" style="width:20%" class="leftimg"/>
			<li><span class = "font1">
			Function: </span>  A named bit of programming instructions.
			</li>
			<li><span class = "font1">
			Top Down Design: </span> a problem solving approach (also known as stepwise design) in which you break down a system to gain insight into the sub-systems that make it up.
			</li>
			<li><span class = "font1">
			API: </span> a collection of commands made available to a programmer
			</li>
			<li><span class = "font1">
			Documentation: </span> a description of the behavior of a command, function, library, API, etc.
			</li>
			<li><span class = "font1">
			Hexadecimal: </span>  A base-16 number system that uses sixteen distinct symbols 0-9 and A-F to represent numbers from 0 to 15.
			</li>
			<li><span class = "font1">
			Library: </span> a collection of commands / functions, typically with a shared purpose
			</li>
			<li><span class = "font1">
			Parameter : </span>  An extra piece of information passed to a function to customize it for a specific need
			</li>
			<li><span class = "font1">
			For Loop: </span>  Loops that have a predetermined beginning, end, and increment (step interval).
			</li>
			<li><span class = "font1">
			Loop: </span> The action of doing something over and over again.
			</li>
